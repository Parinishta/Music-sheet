# Music-sheet
Transcribing a Music sheet

In our project, we try to transcribe a given music sheet. We have stored the given music sheet as MUSI.jpeg 

We aim to find the count( duration) of each note and the name of each note. The duration of each note can be determined by applying RCNN on sorted classes which contain our dataset of images. Each class of images denotes a new duration of the note.

Our dataset was obtained from here : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kishanj/music-notes-datasets
We have imported various libraries which include pickle,tensorflow,opencv etc and have tried to include them above .

OUR MAIN CODE IS STORED IN THE FILE NAMED musco.ipynb
